I am currently an undergraduate student at [Computer Science School, Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/). I am also a research intern at [SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/) now, focusing on computer vision tasks in autonomous driving. And I just finished my summer research at [iNCML Lab, York University](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/lab/MLL/start), supervised by Professor [Hui Jiang](https://wiki.eecs.yorku.ca/user/hj/). You can find my CV [here](/files/resume.pdf).
